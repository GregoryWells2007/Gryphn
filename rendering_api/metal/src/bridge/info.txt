UHHHHHHH I FUCKING HATE APPLE WHY DO I HAVE TO WRITE OBJECTIVE C JUST SO THAT I CAN OPEN A WINDOW
AND THAN DRAW SHIT TO IT WHY DONT YOU JUST LET ME DO ALL THIS SHIT IN PLAIN C LIKE ANY OTHER

NO ONE IN THERE LIFE HAS EVER WANTED TO WRITE OBJECTIVE C BECAUSE IT IS THE BIGGEST
PEICE OF SHIT OF ALL TIME BUT THIS IS THE LITTLE OBJECTIVE C THAT I NEEDED TO WRITE TO GET
ALL OF THIS TO WORK.
